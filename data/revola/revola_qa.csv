1. **Conversion Rates** - tracking how many leads complete desired actions (e.g., purchases or booking sales calls).
2. **Engagement Metrics** - assessing click-through rates and call-to-action (CTA) engagement.
3. **Conversation-to-Meeting Conversion Rates** - measuring how effectively conversations translate into scheduled meetings.
4. **Lead Qualification Scoring** - evaluating leads based on custom-defined rules to assess fit and interest.
5. **ABM Outreach Response and Engagement Levels** - monitoring the response rates and overall engagement levels from the targeted outreach efforts.
6. **Analytics Built Into the System** - conversion rates, time to value, and hand-off rates for continual improvement.
