(High Value Customers)","How does Reva leverage company data and intent signals to identify and qualify high-value customers, and what metrics can we expect to improve?","Reva leverages company data and intent signals by analyzing market data, digital intent signals (such as job postings, tech adoption, and web visits), and CRM insights to identify 10 high-potential companies each week.
