She combines this information with custom qualification logic to prioritize accounts showing strong buying signals. Additionally, Reva conducts stakeholder mapping to identify relevant decision-makers and influencers within those accounts based on role, seniority, and past engagement history.\n\nBy using behavioral signals and asking key qualification questions, Reva performs interactive qualification in real-time. If a lead qualifies, she books a meeting with a sales rep and sends the relevant context to the CRM.\n\nAs a result of this approach, we can expect improvements in metrics such as the prioritization of high-value accounts, the routing of hot leads to sales in real-time, refinement of the ideal customer profile (ICP) based on engagement outcomes, and optimization of outreach for segments that show the highest conversion potential."
