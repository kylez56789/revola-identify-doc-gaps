  "Ultimately the decision to fine-tune a pre-trained model or to train a model from scratch depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the similarity between the pre-trained model's task and the new task, the availability of necessary computational resources (we got you covered there), and overall time constraints.",
  "To make it as easy as possible, Cerebras developed the flow chart to the right to help guide you.",
  "If you have a small dataset, fine-tuning a pre-trained model can be a good option.",
  "In fine-tuning, you take a pre-trained model and retrain it on a new dataset specific to your task.",
  "This approach can save you time since the pre-trained model has already learned general features from a large dataset.",
  "Fine-tuning can also help to avoid overfitting on small datasets.",
  "However, if you have a large dataset, training a model from scratch may be a better option.",
  "Training a model from scratch allows you to have more control over the architecture, hyperparameters, and optimization strategy, which can lead to better performance on the specific task.",
