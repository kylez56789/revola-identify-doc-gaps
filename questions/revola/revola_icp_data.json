      "use_cases": "Instant Sales Engagement: Traditional “Book a demo” CTAs often create friction and lead to missed opportunities. Revola replaces this with a seamless “Meet now” experience, allowing prospects to instantly engage with a voice-based AI agent (Reva) that guides them through a personalized conversation, supported by visuals. This removes delays and increases the chances of converting interest into action in real time.; Intelligent and Personalized ABM Outreach: Outbound efforts often fall flat when they lack personalization and insight into the target account. Revola analyzes company data, intent signals, and stakeholder roles to craft tailored messages. Reva engages each prospect with a personalized pitch, adapting in real time based on their profile and business context, resulting in higher response rates and stronger ABM performance.; Scalable Lead Qualification: Sales teams can get bogged down spending too much time qualifying leads manually. Reva handles the first interaction with leads, asking smart qualifying questions, capturing intent, and only routing high-value prospects to sales. This builds a scalable qualification layer without needing to expand headcount.; Event and Webinar Follow-up: Event-generated leads often lose momentum before sales can reach them. With Revola, follow-up begins immediately through a conversational AI agent, Reva, that re-engages attendees, answers common questions, and offers instant meeting booking. This keeps interest warm and helps convert leads into pipeline more effectively.; Product Education and Onboarding: Static content often fails to clearly communicate product value. Revola's voice agent Reva walks users through product features in an engaging, interactive way using visuals like dashboards, charts, and demos. This helps users quickly understand key benefits and leads to stronger onboarding and retention outcomes.",
